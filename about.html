    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in a middle-class village farmer's house, where education was valued but resources were limited. My early years in school were marked by average grades and a lack of confidence. However, everything changed when I got admitted to a prestigious Christian convent school in the city for further studies.

I stepped into my new school and felt like a tiny drop in the ocean. Everything seemed big and overwhelming, but my teachers and peers welcomed me with open hearts. The school's motto, "Love and Service," became my guiding principle.

As I navigated the school, I received incredible support from everyone – seniors, juniors, and staff members. I gained confidence, participated in class, made it to the topper list. I even overcame my stage fright by speaking openly in speeches and anchoring school programs.

As I progressed, I became part of school organizations and was elected head girl. I realized that my journey was transformed by the school's support system.
